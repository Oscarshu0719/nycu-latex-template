	\textbf{Optical Character Reader (OCR)} is a useful tool. In this project, an OCR to recognize music notes is implemented. \\
	If a stave is input to be recognize, first, locate the five horizontal lines and capture the region. Second, extract the music notes from the captured image. 
	Third, input the extracted music notes to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model; then, the model will recognize each music note. \\
	In this project, the most important part, the third part, is implemented. \\
	For the selected data set, the accuracy rate can be \textbf{98\%}.
