	The network structure for CNN is a problem, I have tried several times to make the network works better. \\
	However, The network structure maybe work well only for this data set. 
	If the network structure is not well-selected and the data set is too small, it may over-fit. \\
	OCR is a cool implementation using deep learning and usually seen in normal life. It can be also used for another object and the result will be significant, 
	and make lives more convenient.
